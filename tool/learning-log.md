Today I watched and followed along with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAdWDHb3zPQ which was a tutorial on the basics and made a small animation of balls bouncing against walls using phaser. I also learned the main functions of Phaser like `preload()` `create()` `update()` froomo this  tutorial. `preload()` loads game assets like pictures before the game begins. `create()` adds objects like sprites into the game. `update()` constantly updates the game for things like movement.
